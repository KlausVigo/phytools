This repository contains source code, documentation, and R data for the project "phytools: Phylogenetic Tools for Comparative Biology (and Other Things)."

**NOTE**: the current *phytools* version (>= 1.3-9) depends on *ape* >= 5.6-5 which is not yet available on CRAN but can be installed from its *GitHub* using the *remotes* package as follows:

```
remotes::install_github("emmanuelparadis/ape")
```

The development version of *phytools* can then in turn be installed using *remotes*:

```
remotes::install_github("liamrevell/phytools")
```

Comments & pull requests are welcome; however, those not involving *actual software bugs* (which I always try to fix as promptly as I can) may not always be addressed in a timely manner.
